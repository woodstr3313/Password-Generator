# Password-Generator

This application was created to generate passwords. I updated the Javascript file to allow this application to function the appropriate way. I first added comments to my javascript file and then started out by running a console.log to see what was happening on the page. I then created a bank to hold each of my characters in. I then created prompts to assist the user in making their selections on the website. I then finished by adding the code to automatically generate the password.
